Inspiration for this game comes from an existing game called New Star Soccer, which can be downloaded from the App Store and the Google Play Store. In this game you also climb the ranks of football and also take decisions into your own hands.

This game (Footy Fever) was chosen to appeal to its intended target audience, which is football fans of all ages. The game is designed to be a simple and fun game for its target audience. 

### How To Play 

In this game Footy Fever, users will be playing to reach the heights of their footballing career. By starting just out of a youth club and potentially ending up in a whole different continent by the end of the game. Along the way the user will chose clubs that they’ll play for and even take part in salary negotiations. Upon finishing their time at a certain club, they’ll be presented with their stats as a player and all the trophies they’ve won!

* The user can chose the club they want to transfer to once their time with their current club expires. 
* The user can engage in contract negotiations to potentially increase their weekly wages, but risking these negotiations can backfire. 
* The user can chose if they like to sign on to a sponsorship deal. 
* Along the way the user can pick up prestigious footballing awards. 
* The user will be presented with in-game scenarios and they must take control of their actions. 
* By the end of the game the user should have achieved footballing stardom, with incredible personal and team accolades.
